# Exports Folder

This is where the exports will live for the time being, as there isn't a proper database-type setup implemented just yet. To be honest, I don't even remember what I had in mind as far as data storage goes, other than it the fact that it needs to be somewhat table-based to ensure that exports are modular and not statically set.

ANYWAYS, sorry to ramble, here's how this goes:

### flight-***.csv
I guess people use these for excel? Not sure, but here it is.

### flight-***.json 
This format makes the most sense for long-term storage since it can be so easily parsed later. I say, keep these for your archive.

### flight-***.kml
The obligatory Google Earth file. I mean, I like Google Earth. But this is bound to change a lot, as I grow sick of whatever color the trajectory is predicted in that week.
