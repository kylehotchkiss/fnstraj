# Exports Folder

This is mostly defunct as of 0.3.4, where fnstraj started writing to a database instead. As it was designed to run as a daemon from day one, this was really more of a scaffolding feature. I may bring it back in the future, if I can figure out how to make the terminal interface user-friendly enough (but right now, the amount of required data is really just too vast to be feasible). 

** Note, the predictor is not currently set up to output files - the code is there, but there is nothing to determine the proper context for outputting files, thinking of something :)
