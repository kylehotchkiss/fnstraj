# Exports Folder

This is mostly defunct as of 0.3.4, where fnstraj started writing to a database instead. As it was designed to run as a daemon from day one, this was really more of a scaffolding feature. I may bring it back in the future, if I can figure out how to make the terminal interface user-friendly enough (but right now, the amount of required data is really just too vast to be feasible). 

If you set your FNSTRAJ_MODE flag to "development" (or don't set it at all), you can still have these files generated. The only one that's really useful is the .kml format.
