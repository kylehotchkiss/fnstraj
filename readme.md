This is the hardest thing I've ever done.

## Hacking
I'm trying to take as minimalistic an approach towards feature cuft as possible. I would personally like to ensure that the core of this app is the highest quality work I am capable of producing. This code has been through two major rewrites before the alpha ever existed! if you would like to hack at the code, go for it! It's not my intension to bring every great feature upstream, but I would love to see what people can turn this codebase into and how they can make it work better for their personal flights and tracking purposes.
