# fnstraj :: Third Party

Included in this directory are the third party tools required to run fnstraj. These tools are more heavily involved in the interface and frontend of the site rather than the backend. They are all open source, so here's my shoutout to the authors and links to the projects.

### async.js
Async.js is a asyncronous routine helper written by Caolan McMahon and released under the MIT licence.

### backbone.js
Backbone.js is the library that helps keep the fnstraj web interface so fluid. It is the defining factor between feeling like a web app and feeling like an actual app. Written by Jeremy Ashkenas and released under the MIT licence.

### underscore.js
Underscore.js is an awesome helper for working with objects and arrays in Javascript. A little lifesaver perhaps. Written by Jeremy Ashkenas and released under the MIT license.
